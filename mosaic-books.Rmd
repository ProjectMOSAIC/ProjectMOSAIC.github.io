### Books by the mosaic team

* [*Statistical Modeling a Fresh Approach*](https://dtkaplan.github.io/SM2-bookdown/) by Daniel Kaplan
    * [end of chapter exercises](https://www.mosaic-web.org/go/SM2-Problems.pdf)
    * [Statistical Modeling: Computational Technique](https://www.mosaic-web.org/go/SM2-technique/index.html) by Daniel Kaplan and Frank Shaw. This booklet introduces the R language commands for the methods introduced in A Fresh Approach.
    * [A remix by R Pruim](https://statistical-modeling.netlify.app/preface-to-this-electronic-edition.html)
* [*MOSAIC Calculus*](https://dtkaplan.github.io/MOSAIC-Calculus/) by Daniel T Kaplan
* [*Foundations and Applications of Statistics: An Introduction using R*](https://bookstore.ams.org/amstext-28/) by Randall Pruim
* [*Lessons in Statistical Thinking*](https://dtkaplan.github.io/Lessons-in-statistical-thinking/) by Daniel Kaplan. This is a replacement for the traditional introduction to statistical inference using `lm()` to streamline and unify the many "tests" that crowd introductory courses. It has a strong orientation to decision-making, briefly introduces Bayesian concepts, and treats p-values in a way that is honest but respects their ubiquitous use in statistical practice. *Lessons in Statistical Thinking* can be used together with the data-science oriented [*ModernDive*](moderndive.org) text. Use the first half of *ModernDive* for the first half of an intro course and *Lessons* for the second half. Both texts are free, online, and open source.
* [*A Student's Guide to R*](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/LittleBooks/raw/master/StudentGuide/MOSAIC-StudentGuide.pdf) is organized by analysis method. It demonstrates how to perform all of the statistical analyses typically covered in an Intro Stats.
