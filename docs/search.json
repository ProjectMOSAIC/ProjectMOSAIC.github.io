The core resources\ndeveloped during that time continue to be maintained and expanded. New\nMOSAIC resources such as a calculus textbook and the Little Apps are\nbeing added and improved in the 2020s.\nNEWS: A workshop\nintroducing the new project, Lessons\nin Statistical Thinking, will be offered at USCOTS 2023 May 30-31,\n2023\nMOSAIC resources\nThe {mosaic} package for R which supports teaching\nstats using a expressive, compact, and consistent formula syntax. This\nminimizes start up costs for students and enables students to calculate\ndescriptive statistics, create statistical graphics, and construct\nstatistical graphics. {mosaic} is one of three main\nsyntaxes for teaching and doing statistics using R. (For a comparison,\nsee Prof. Amelia McNamara’s video\npresentation.)\nHundreds of instructors have found {mosaic} helpful in\nteaching introductory statistics. Example:\n\n\nStats <- df_stats(births ~ wday, data = Births2015, \n                    center = mean, conf = ci.mean(0.95))\n  Stats\n\n  response wday    center conf_lower conf_upper\n1   births  Sun  7397.808   7319.233   7476.383\n2   births  Mon 11739.385  11490.746  11988.023\n3   births  Tue 12585.808  12461.750  12709.866\n4   births  Wed 12279.096  12140.249  12417.944\n5   births  Thu 12083.434  11775.866  12391.001\n6   births  Fri 11834.558  11550.568  12118.547\n7   births  Sat  8357.096   8250.949   8463.243\n\nThe {ggformula} package, which enables ggplot2\ngraphics to be generated using the formula syntax. Example:\n\n\ngf_jitter(births ~ wday, data = Births2015, alpha = 0.5) %>%\n    gf_errorbar(conf_lower + conf_upper ~ wday, data = Stats, \n                color = ~ wday, inherit=FALSE)\n\n\n\nThe LittleApps developed with the MAA StatPREP project. These are data- and\ngraphics-centric tools for teaching introductory statistics without\ncoding. See the\nLittleApps site for more information.\nA complete MOSAIC\nCalculus course including an online, freely accessible\ntextbook, exercises, and symbolic software in R, all following the\nProject MOSAIC philosophy of building courses around modeling,\nusing data, and integrating computing directly into\nthe subject matter.\nOnline, freely accessible texts for teaching statistics that are\ncoordinated with the {mosaic} R package.\nStatistical\nModeling: A Fresh Approach by Daniel Kaplan\nEnd-of-chapter exercises for\nStatistical Modeling. Answers are available to instructors\nupon request.\nStatistical Modeling:\nComputational Technique by Daniel Kaplan and Frank Shaw. This\nbooklet introduces the R language commands for the methods introduced in\nA Fresh Approach.\nA\nStudent’s Guide to R\n\n\n\n\n",

This is a replacement\nfor the traditional introduction to statistical inference using\nlm() to streamline and unify the many “tests” that crowd\nintroductory courses. It has a strong orientation to decision-making,\nbriefly introduces Bayesian concepts, and treats p-values in a way that\nis honest but respects their ubiquitous use in statistical practice.\nLessons in Statistical Thinking can be used together with the\ndata-science oriented ModernDive\ntext. Use the first half of ModernDive for the first half of an\nintro course and Lessons for the second half. Both texts are\nfree, online, and open source.\nA\nStudent’s Guide to R is organized by analysis method. It\ndemonstrates how to perform all of the statistical analyses typically\ncovered in an Intro Stats.\nBooks by other authors\nMathematical\nModeling and Applied Calculus\n\n\n\n",

The vignettes\ngive a good introduction to the package. See the Mosaic\nCalculus textbook for many more examples.\nModeling packages\nIn beta: {math300} is\nthe prototype replacement for {mosaicModel} providing\nhighly unified commands for lm() and glm()\nregression modeling. Install with\nremotes::install_github(\"dtkaplan/math300\"). See Lessons\nin Statistical Thinking for an introduction.\nDeprecated: {mosaicModel}\n– This package is retained for compatibility with the DataCamp\ncourses on statistical modeling. Many of the features have been\ntransferred to the core mosaic packages listed above.\n\n",
