      "contents": "\nProject MOSAIC\nProject MOSAIC is a community of educators working\nto develop a new way to introduce mathematics, statistics, computation\nand modeling to students in colleges and universities.\nFrom 2009 to 2016, Project MOSAIC was supported by a grant from the\nUS National Science Foundation (NSF DUE-0920350). The core resources\ndeveloped during that time continue to be maintained and expanded.\nAmong those resources are:\nThe {mosaic} package for R which supports teaching\nstats using a expressive, compact, and consistent formula syntax. This\nminimizes start up costs for students and enables students to calculate\ndescriptive statistics, create statistical graphics, and construct\nstatistical graphics. {mosaic} is one of three main\nsyntaxes for teaching and doing statistics using R. (For a comparison,\nsee Prof. Amelia McNamara’s video\npresentation.)\nHundreds of instructors have found {mosaic} helpful in\nteaching introductory statistics. Example:\n\n\nStats <- df_stats(births ~ wday, data = Births2015, \n                    center = mean, conf = ci.mean(0.95))\n  Stats\n\n  response wday    center conf_lower conf_upper\n1   births  Sun  7397.808   7319.233   7476.383\n2   births  Mon 11739.385  11490.746  11988.023\n3   births  Tue 12585.808  12461.750  12709.866\n4   births  Wed 12279.096  12140.249  12417.944\n5   births  Thu 12083.434  11775.866  12391.001\n6   births  Fri 11834.558  11550.568  12118.547\n7   births  Sat  8357.096   8250.949   8463.243\n\nThe {ggformula} package, which enables ggplot2\ngraphics to be generated using the formula syntax. Example:\n\n\ngf_jitter(births ~ wday, data = Births2015, alpha = 0.5) %>%\n    gf_errorbar(conf_lower + conf_upper ~ wday, data = Stats, \n                color = ~ wday, inherit=FALSE)\n\n\n\nThe LittleApps developed with the MAA StatPREP project. These are data- and\ngraphics-centric tools for teaching introductory statistics without\ncoding. See the\nLittleApps site for more information.\nA complete MOSAIC\nCalculus course including an online, freely accessible\ntextbook, exercises, and symbolic software in R, all following the\nProject MOSAIC philosophy of building courses around modeling,\nusing data, and integrating computing directly into\nthe subject matter.\nOnline, freely accessible texts for teaching statistics that are\ncoordinated with the {mosaic} R package.\nStatistical\nModeling: A Fresh Approach by Daniel Kaplan\nEnd-of-chapter exercises for\nStatistical Modeling. Answers are available to instructors\nupon request.\nStatistical Modeling:\nComputational Technique by Daniel Kaplan and Frank Shaw. This\nbooklet introduces the R language commands for the methods introduced in\nA Fresh Approach.\n\n\n\n\n",
