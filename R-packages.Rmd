* `{mosaic}`
    - `{mosaicCore}`
    - `{mosaicData}`
* `{ggformula}`
* `{mosaicCalc}` -- Those following the progress of the USAFA modeling-based calculus course should install from GitHub: `remotes::install_github("ProjectMOSAIC/mosaicCalc@beta")`
* `{mosaicModel}` -- This package is in an indeterminate state while we figure out how to integrate with the many modeling packages introduced as part of the `{tidyverse}`.
